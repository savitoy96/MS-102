--------  

* The "tenant" represents the resources associated with your organization 
* The tenant is stored in Europe or North America
* The tenant includes a single Azure Active Directory instance 
* You can also have a tenant with multiple geographical locations and move your tenant from one location to another
* With Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, your organization can expand its Microsoft 365 presence to multiple geographic regions and/or countries within your existing tenant.
* For multiple Microsoft 365 tenants (not ideal), the following exist:
	- Inter-tenant collaboration
	- Cross-tenant mailbox migration 
	- Tenant-to-tenant migration 
* To add, modify, or remove domains, you must be a Domain Name Administrator or Global Administrator
* You can now add up to 5 onmicrosoft domain names. You can designate one as the fallback default.

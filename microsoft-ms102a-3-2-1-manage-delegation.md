Learner Objective: *Learn about delegation in Microsoft 365 environments.*    

Description: In this episode, you will learn about delegation options as they exist in Microsoft 365.

--------  

* In Microsoft 365, delegation refers to the process of granting someone else the ability to access and manage certain aspects of your account or perform actions on your behalf. 
* Delegation allows you to share responsibilities and grant specific permissions to others while retaining control over your account. 
* There are various types of delegation in Microsoft 365, including:
	- Calendar delegation
	- Mailbox delegation
	- SharePoint delegation
	- Microsoft Teams delegation 
* Exchange hybrid deployments support the use of some, but not all, mailbox permissions between mailboxes located in an on-premises Exchange organization and mailboxes located in Microsoft 365 or Office 365. 
* You can delegate admin to administrative units - this is Azure AD resource that an be a container for other Azure AD resources
* An administrative unit can only contain users, groups, or devices 
* Administrative units restrict permissions in a role to any portion of your organization that you define. You could, for example, use administrative units to delegate the Helpdesk Administrator role to regional support specialists, so they can manage users only in the region that they support.

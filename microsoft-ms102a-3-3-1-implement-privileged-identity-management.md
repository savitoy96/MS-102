Learner Objective: *Learn about Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in the context of Microsoft 365*    

Description: In this episode, you will learn about PIM in the context of Microsoft 365. This feature enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. 

--------  

* Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service in Azure Active Directory that enables management of important resources in the tenant
* Thanks to PIM, organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure AD resources
* Use of this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P2 license 
* Some key features include:
	- Provide just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources
	- Assign time-bound access to resources using start and end dates
	- Require approval to activate privileged roles
	- Enforce multi-factor authentication to activate any role
	- Use justification to understand why users activate
	- Get notifications when privileged roles are activated
	- Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles
	- Download audit history for internal or external audit
	- Prevents removal of the last active Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator role assignments
* Once you set up Privileged Identity Management, you'll see Tasks, Manage, and Activity options in the left navigation menu. 
* As an administrator, you'll choose between options such as managing Azure AD roles, managing Azure resource roles, or PIM for Groups. 
* When you choose what you want to manage, you see the appropriate set of options for that option.

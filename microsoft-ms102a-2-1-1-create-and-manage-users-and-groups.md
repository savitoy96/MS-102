Description: In this episode, you will learn how to create users and groups in Microsoft 365. You will also learn to create guest users and contacts. 

--------  

* Create a user account for each team member that needs to access the Microsoft products and services 
* Easiest method - add them individually in MS 365 Admin Center 
* Once this step is accomplished, users have:
	- MS 365 license
	- Sign in credentials
	- MS 365 mailboxes 
* You must be a Global Admin, License Admin, or User Admin to add accounts 
* Go to Users > Active users > Add a user 
* Need to add multiple users - various methods: 
	- CSV file
	- PowerShell
	- Active Directory synchronization
	- Migration from Microsoft Exchange 
* Microsoft 365 Groups allows you to give groups of people access to shared resources
* Groups have the following roles:
	- Owners, members, guests 
* Contacts are people outside your organization that you'd like everyone to be able to find. Anyone listed here can be found in ‎Outlook‎ under People in ‎Microsoft 365‎. You can add Contacts with the Users > Contacts menu item. 
* Guest users  - by default, guest access is turned on 
* Any guest users that you create are added to a Guest Users group 
* Currently, you are brought to Azure Active Directory when you are ready to create your guest user
